                                                                                                    [Verse 1]
I know I don't want to
Be the one that you run to
When you got nowhere else to go
When you need some love
I know I'm the last one
You try to call but
I always give in
To give you it all

[Chorus]
Oh-oh
I can't be your midnight love
Oh-oh-oh
When your silver is my gold
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear I'm blind
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear you're mine

[Verse 2]
I hope that the right time one day arrives
So I'll be willing to let this die
Able to look you right in the eyes
Say I'm not your consolation prize

[Chorus]
Oh-oh
I can't be your midnight love
Oh-oh-oh
When your silver is my gold
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear I'm blind
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear you're mine

[Bridge]
I can't be your second best
Close but not your favorite
I keep going back for more
Where there's nothing from before

[Outro]
I can't be your midnight love
Oh-oh-oh
When your silver is my gold
I can't be your second best
Close but not your favorite
I keep going back for more
Where there's nothing from before
